# meloader
This is an Intel Management Engine a.k.a Intel ME firmware loader plugin for IDA.

To use it simply put the _meloader.py_ file and _ _meloader_ directory under the _loaders_ directory of your IDA installation.

It was tested on Intel ME firmware versions 9.x and should work on all other versions prior to 10.x (but, of course, that is not guaranteed :).

Feel free to ask any questions or submit a pull request!
